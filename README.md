# Apnea-Detection-using-ECG
The objective was to develop a system that can allow the diagnosis of sleep apnea in a cost-effective way. With the help of heart arrythmia, weâ€™re going to detect apnea events. Electrocardiography (ECG) signals from standardized medical datasets will be used to derive relevant diagnostic information which will then be used to estimate when an apnea is occurring.

The system made was able to detect apnea with an accuracy of 94.6%
