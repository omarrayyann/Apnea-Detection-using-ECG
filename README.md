# Apnea-Detection-using-ECG
The objective was to develop a system that can allow the diagnosis of sleep apnea in a cost-effective way. Electrocardiography (ECG) signals from standardized medical datasets were used to derive relevant diagnostic information which was then used to estimate when an apnea is occurring.

The system made was able to detect apnea with an accuracy of 94.6%
